            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a professional software and web developer with strong experience in C# and C++,
                which has allowed me to build efficient, high-performance applications across various platforms.
                My background includes developing software solutions with a focus on logical problem-solving,
                clean code, and optimized performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am expanding my skill set into web development,
                focusing on front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                This enables me to create dynamic,
                user-friendly web applications with responsive designs and seamless user experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach to development is rooted in continuous learning, adaptability, and collaboration.
                I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends,
                tools, and frameworks to deliver innovative and reliable solutions in both software and web development environments.
